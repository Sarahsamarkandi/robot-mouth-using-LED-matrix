# robot-mouth-using-LED-matrix
For my task in the electronics and IoT track at Smart Methods, I am working on connecting the robot's mouth using Wokwi, a powerful online simulator for electronics projects. This involves designing the circuit and programming the necessary controls to enable the robot's mouth to function effectively. By utilizing Wokwi, I can simulate and test the connections and behavior of the components, ensuring a reliable and efficient implementation. This task not only enhances my practical skills in electronics and IoT but also contributes to the overall functionality and interactivity of the robot.
